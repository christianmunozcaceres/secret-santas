# Secret Santa API

An API where you can create users, groups and then assign a [secret santa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Santa) to everyone in the group! Assigning also takes into consideration your gift-history, so if you gave a gift to a person last year, you won't be assigned to give to them again this year.

This project was built in Typescript with Express.
